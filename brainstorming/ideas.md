| Charlie | 5.31.20 | is there a better way to ideas? / developments? |
| Subegh  | 6.8.20  | Add footnotes in view creation so teachers can create notes for each document
                      Example use case would be if a document mentions a location that no longer exists. E.g. Yugoslavia, teacher would                         add footnote to mark Serbia location on map function |
| Subegh  | 6.8.20  | Possibly use access codes for sharing stories
